    "In the previous notebook, we discussed an overview of what deep learning is and why you might want to use it for cognitive modeling. In the present notebook, we will review some acoustic aspects of speech and then construct a model of phoneme recognition that we will use to investigate the recognition of morphologically complex words and how the dscriminability of segments changes over time.\n",

    "1. **Phonemes here are being used in the engineering/speech recognition sense**, which is only semi-related to how phonemes are discussed and used in linguistics. Here, they are used to refer to acoustically similar segments of speech, such as that /s/ will be acoustically similar in many of the instances in which it is encountered. The motivation for using phonemes is that a wide variety of deep neural networks that work with speech are designed to recognize phonemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **We are not using any sort of holdout data for testing or validation of the model.** Best practices for deep learning modeling are to have some data held out to assess the model on items it hasn't seen. Given the timeframe we are working with, we will eschew validating the model that we are training against novel data. This is not unlike using statistical regression models for psycholinguistic experiments, either, where it is typical to use all of the collected data for analysis. Nevertheless, more serious experimentation should involve more evalution of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Some bits of code that are used for loading and formatting data will be placed inside a `Julia` script that is called from within this notebook.** The code is available for you to peruse in the GitHub repository that the present notebook is part of, but the code will not be discussed in detail during the course of this workshop. The code otherwise distracts from the purposes of setting up and interpreting a deep learning model."

    "At first blush, the decreasing entropy trend is not particularly salient, even with this loess smoothed curve. However, consider that coarticulatory cues may provide extra information about upcoming segments. We might expect then that the entropy will start to decrease about halfway through the segment preceding its uniqueness point. And in fact, this is what is observed in these visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For *wrestler*, halfway between /ER/ and the silence or offset, the entropy begins decreasing\n",
    "* For *wrestlers*, halfway between /ER/ and /Z/, the entropy begins decreasing\n",
    "* For *wrestling*, the entropy slows its increase until the start of [IH], after which the entropy sees a steady decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "We might consider this evidence that the model has indeed learned some sort of temporal sequencing related to uniqueness points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider another set of words, *walk*, *walked*, and *walkers*. In these data, *walk* becomes unique at the end of /K/, *walked* becomes unique at the beginning of /T/, and *walkers* becomes unique at the beginning of /ER/. If the previously observed pattern is consistent, however, we should expect to see changes in the entropy from about the midpoint of the unique segment."

    "* For *walk*, there is a bit of a rise in the entropy when the model is unsure whether the /K/ is the end of the word or if there is still an upcoming /T/. At about halfway through the segment, the entropy decreases as the model becomes more sure that the end of the word is coming up.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For *walked*, there is a rise in entropy after the start of the /K/, but it falls once the /T/ begins. It is unlikely that the model would have enough time from the closure of the /K/ to the release of the /T/ to pick up on any coarticulatory cues, so it makes sense that the entropy doesn't begin to decrease until the /T/ begins. The eventual rise in entropy could be due to the /T/ taking longer than expected to be completed since it does appear to have a long duration here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For *walkers*, the entropy generally falls until partway through /ER/, after which it begins to rise, only to fall after /Z/. This could be due to there having been some other word that had a similar sequencing as *walkers*. However, in this particular data set, there don't appear to be many or any candidates that could cause this sort of competition. If you inspect the audio file for *walkers*, there are some peculiar acoustic qualities to it. The speaker uses creaky voice throughout, and the vowel becomes devoiced toward the end of it. These acoustic qualities may contribute to /ER/ in this word being a poor exemplar of the overall /ER/ sound, so the model is less sure about the identity of the segment. The waveform and spectrogram are presented below.\n",

    "# Conclusion of analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous analysis gave some interesting results, suggesting that entropy generally decreases once an acoustic signal uniquely identifies a word. Obviously, there are limitations to completely extending this to human perception generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We only looked qualitatively at the results of two trios of words\n",
    "* The neural network here was trained on one speaker\n",
    "* There was only one exemplar of each word\n",
    "* Words were presented in isolation\n",
    "* Only 10,000 words were selected, and they were selected randomly (not by, say, frequency)\n",
    "* The network does not reach human performance in phoneme identification\n",
    "* Phonemes *per se* have a questionable relationship with the acoustic signal\n",
    "* The network was not validated or evaluated on any other data sets, so we have no indication of its goodness of fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, insofar as both human perception and an artificial neural networks perform discrimination, the network serves as **paltry** evidence for the provocative idea that it is possible that human perception encodes these temporal patterns before even recognizing word forms. If this observation were to hold across a variety of other items and we resolved the limitations listed above, word form recognition—and thus semantic activation—would be said to begin during the processing of the acoustic signal, and not strictly after some sort of processing into discrete and/or abstract units."

    "# Workshop conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we covered a number of topics. Primary among these topics were the construction of neural networks and how they might be used as models of cognition. Deep learning is a field of academic inquiry in its own right, so we have barely even scratched the surface of what is possible using deep learning methods. Things to try going forward might be to look at some sort of output other than phonemes (or graphemes) and some layer types that might be easier to interpret, such as convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming away from this workshop, my hope is that you now better understand what decisions go into making a deep learning model and why a researcher might use one for cognitive modeling and not just computational problem solving. Additionally, I hope that I have provided enough terminology and references (particularly in the previous notebook) for those interested in further research that they can search for and find further resources."
